### Day 1: Introduction to Java

#### Topics
1. **What is Java?**
   - Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**
   - **Installing JDK (Java Development Kit)**
     - Download the JDK from the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
     - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
     - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your JDK installation directory.
   - **Installing an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
     - **Eclipse**
       - Download Eclipse from the [Eclipse download page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
       - Follow the installation instructions.
     - **IntelliJ IDEA**
       - Download IntelliJ IDEA from the [JetBrains download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
       - Follow the installation instructions.

3. **Writing Your First Java Program**
   - **Creating a "Hello, World!" Program**
     - Open your IDE and create a new Java project.
     - Create a new Java class named `HelloWorld`.
     - Write the following code in the `HelloWorld.java` file:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

#### Tasks
1. **Install JDK and an IDE**
   - Follow the instructions above to download and install JDK and an IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
   - Set up your IDE for Java development.

2. **Create a Simple "Hello, World!" Program**
   - Open your IDE.
   - Create a new Java project.
   - Create a new Java class named `HelloWorld`.
   - Write and run the "Hello, World!" program.
